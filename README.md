# project3_wine

## Project Description

* As a data science consultant Team BCR will find the drivers of wine quality for the California Wine Institute. We will find clusters within the data for exploration, understanding and modeling to present to the data science team for winery supply chain marketing. The project will culminate in a presentation to the data science team.

## Project Goals

* Use clusters to help your exploration, understanding, and modeling of the data.

* The target variable you are trying to predict is wine quality (you may decide whether you want to solve this with classification or regression)

* If we use a cluster number as a feature, that cluster should NOT have the target variable of wine quality in it.

* Other key drivers:
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * 
## Initial Thoughts

* 

## The Plan

* Acquire: build organization repository named Team BCR and invite members. Pull winequality-red.csv and winequality-white.csv into repository. Build .gitignore and env.py files.

* Prepare the data using the following columns:
    * target: 12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
    * features:
        * 1 - fixed acidity
        * 2 - volatile acidity
        * 3 - citric acid
        * 4 - residual sugar
        * 5 - chlorides
        * 6 - free sulfur dioxide
        * 7 - total sulfur dioxide
        * 8 - density
        * 9 - pH
        * 10 - sulphates
        * 11 - alcohol

* Explore dataset for predictors of property value ('__')
    * Answer the following questions:
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * 

* Develop a model
    * Using the selected data features develop appropriate predictive models
    * Evaluate the models in action using train and validate splits as well as scaled data
    * Choose the most accurate model 
    * Evaluate the most accurate model using the final test data set
    * Draw conclusions
